  Game Store built with React
</p>

## Short Description
An e-commerce store, imitating a Game Store, built with React. Includes dedicated game pages, a search functionality, genre and rating filters, a like feature and a wishlist. Responsive to the bone and tested with Jest. You can find a list of [features](#features), [performance tests](#performance) and [technologies used](#technologies-used) below.

## üî¥ Demo
üß™ [Live Demo](https://gianlucajahn.github.io/react-ecommerce-store) available. Click "Live Demo" to open it.

## Showcase
You can see images and a GIF of the project in user interaction below. The user starts on the landing page, navigates through the browse section, selects a game, adds it to their cart and opens the cart. The GIF does not show all features of the shop, it only shows the most elementary user interactions. <br /> <br />

## Performance
I let [Google Lighthouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=de) run over my application to check for it's **performance, accessibility, use of best practices and SEO optimization**. You can view the results right below this paragraph.

## Motivation
My motivations in building this project were showcasing what I learned so far and to have somewhat of a "sandbox" to experiment and build within. I was able to learn new libraries and I had to be creative with ways to increase my application's performance. I also believed that building a project with a much bigger codebase than my preceding ones and learning how to organize such a codebase could set me off better for work in a business environment - and it did.

## Features
- Expressive, responsive and clear UI/UX
- Extensive unit and integration tests to ensure intentional behaviour
- Search any game you want
- Filters to sort after genres and ratings
- Like & Wishlist feature to track your personal wishlist
- Smooth Animations with Framer Motion
- Quick Navigation to view all parts of the project without having to click through it

## Technologies Used
- React
- React Router Dom
- Framer Motion
- Jest
- CSS
- Git
- CDN 

## What I learned:
- Using motion libraries (e.g. Framer Motion) to achieve much smoother user experiences while maintaining clean code
- Working with a CDN (Cloud Delivery Network) to improve performance by accelerating bundle delivery
- organizing and connect a project with React Router Dom
